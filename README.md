# arz-conjugation

My attempt to practice Egyptian Arabic verbs, acknowleding not only individual forms as learning items, but also tenses, negation as a concept, tenses with or without negation, etc.

## Tech

Standard `vite` `vue3` `ts` app. Go `npm i`, `npm run dev`.


## Maintenance


### Adding more stuff from Anki

- export from a word to `src/data/anki/$word.txt`
- replace all `""` with `"`
- replace `class=english` with `class="english"`
- run script in `scripts`
- manually change top line of `data.json` to `export const words = {` and rename it to a `ts` file

### Info

- participle is currently exclusively intepreted as the speaker referring to themselves
